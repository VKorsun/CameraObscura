DOES NOT PROVIDE IMAGE OUTPUT YET

plug-in executes asynchronously on the rising edge of the Capture input signal.

lots of debug output is currently dumped to the console, give it a quick look for camera connection and recognition status. not all cameras support ImageCaptureCore's tethered shooting. those supported by this patch are likely to be similar to that of aperture 2 or greater. see below for a link to a list and additional usage and debugging information.
