DOES NOT PROVIDE IMAGE OUTPUT YET

plug-in executes synchronously on the rising edge of the Capture input signal.

not all cameras support ImageCaptureCore's tethered shooting. aperture 2+'s list of supported cameras is likely to be similar to those supported by this patch. see below for a link to the list which also has additional usage and debugging information. currently, lots of debug output is dumped to the console.
