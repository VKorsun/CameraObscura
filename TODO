OUTPUT
[X] actually take a picture and return as output
[X] redraw image into bitmap context with explicit pixel format, like FastImage

INPUT
[/] Save Location for downloaded images when saving originals. not to be fixed, see below.

EXECUTION
[ ] offer non-blocking asynchronous and blocking synchronous modes, default to async

UI SETTINGS
[/] Save Original toggle, defaults on. not to be fixed - this should instead be done via an image writer patch.
[X] Delete Original toggle to delete from camera, default on
[ ] bind delete original toggle enabled to selected camera capabilities
[ ] populate popup with connected cameras
[ ] add camera status info

GENERAL
[X] make sure the bitmap context backing allocation and release is evenly paired
[X] handle execution stop while downloading/reading [device cancelDownload]. doesn't even get that far
[~] serialization of UI settings
[ ] update company stamp in code / plist
[~] activate deletion and save copy paths in _didReadData:
[ ] create custom plugin icns
[X] add installation information to README
[ ] rewrite README to have an image/movie
[ ] look into block-based KVO'ing
[X] pick a better version numbering system
[ ] think about using CFMakeCollectable() for GC
[X] use build configuration to control debug logging 

TESTING
[ ] compare performance between download and read
[ ] investigate why first run seems to download all images? (does not repro on 5D, D50 only?)
[ ] try operation with two cameras connected, 1 patch
[ ] try operation with two cameras connected, 2 patches - try 2:1 and 2x 1:1
[~] investigate result when capture signal rate is high. LFO period < 2, source file deletes fail?
[ ] test disconnect during download/read 

LATER
[ ] create camera info patch that publishes camera settings like that below
[ ] name, can take pictures, can delete one
[ ] battery status output (batteryLevelAvailable, batteryLevel)
[ ] capacity (contentCatalogPercentCompleted)
